## Inspirations
---
> I got my all inspirations from these existing platforms and I motivated from my fans, and from good people.

1. [`Real Python`](https://realpython.com/)
2. [`W3 Schools`](https://www.w3schools.com/)
3. [`Python official tutorial`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
> The official Python tutorial is not for new programmers, which is bad! So I decided to  create for everyone along with advanced features and much more programming concepts!
4. [`Learn Python`](https://www.learnpython.org/)
